# Zustand Case Study

📚 Skrevet som en del av frontend-utdanningen ved Noroff (2025).  
🎯 Formålet med denne oppgaven var å utforske moderne state management i React, med fokus på biblioteket **Zustand**, og reflektere over egne erfaringer og læringspunkter.

Denne teksten kombinerer teori, kodeeksempler og personlig refleksjon, og viser hvordan Zustand kan brukes som et praktisk og effektivt alternativ til verktøy som Redux og Context API.


# Zustand Case Study

## Introduction

In more complex applications, managing state through props quickly becomes inefficient and hard to maintain. Zustand is a small, fast and scalable state-management library that allows you to create a centralized store for application state and access it from any component, without the need for prop drilling or complicated boilerplate.

React already has `useState`, but that only handles local state. Zustand helps you manage **global** state — like user data, theme settings, or app-wide toggles — while still feeling like you're working with simple React hooks. Zustand is modern, minimal, and fits perfectly into today’s front-end development workflows.

## Features & Use Cases

Zustand uses a simple API built around `create()` to define stores. A store is just an object with state values and functions to update them (actions). Here's a basic example:

```js
import { create } from "zustand";

export const useUserStore = create((set) => ({
  user: null,
  setUser: (user) => set({ user }),
  logout: () => set({ user: null }),
}));
```

You can then access or update state from any component:

```js
const user = useUserStore((state) => state.user);
const setUser = useUserStore((state) => state.setUser);

setUser({ name: "Ole" });
```

This makes Zustand extremely useful for:

- Auth flows (storing user info globally)
- Toggling UI elements like sidebars and modals
- Sharing theme, language, or configuration across the app
- Avoiding prop drilling in large component trees

Zustand also supports middleware like `persist`, which can store the state in localStorage so it doesn’t reset on page refresh. This is especially useful for things like keeping the user logged in.

## History

Zustand was created by the team at Poimandres — the same folks behind `react-three-fiber`, `valtio`, and other forward-thinking React tools. It's written in TypeScript, fully open-source, and designed to replace more complex solutions like Redux for many modern use cases.

Since its release, it has become widely adopted in the React community for its simplicity, performance, and low learning curve.

## Pros & Cons

**Pros:**

- Extremely lightweight (~1kB)
- No boilerplate or setup required
- Works well with TypeScript
- Selective subscriptions = better performance
- Cleaner code: no `dispatch()`, no actions/reducers
- Supports middleware (e.g. `persist`, `devtools`)

**Cons:**

- Less mature than Redux (fewer official patterns for large teams)
- Still requires careful thinking about structure in large apps
- No built-in async helpers (but easy to handle manually)

## Comparison

### Zustand vs useState

`useState` is perfect for local component state, but as your app grows, sharing state through props becomes a mess. Zustand provides a global store that any component can access — without prop drilling.

---

### Zustand vs Redux

Redux is powerful, but heavy and verbose. Even a simple user state requires reducers, actions, types, and a central store. Zustand removes all that: While it can be used with just one file and one function in small projects, it also scales well by letting you split state into separate stores if needed.

---

### Zustand vs Context API

Context avoids prop drilling, but it re-renders all components that subscribe to it whenever the context changes — even if they only need a small part of the state.

Zustand solves this by letting components subscribe only to the exact state they need, reducing unnecessary re-renders and improving performance.

### Summary Table

| Feature          | useState     | Redux           | Context API   | Zustand           |
| ---------------- | ------------ | --------------- | ------------- | ----------------- |
| Setup complexity | Low          | High            | Medium        | Low               |
| Prop drilling    | Yes          | No              | No            | No                |
| Boilerplate      | None         | High            | Low           | None              |
| Performance      | High (local) | Medium          | Can be poor   | High (fine-tuned) |
| Suitable for     | Local state  | Enterprise apps | Simple global | Modern apps       |

## Reflection

As I’ve worked through this case study, Zustand has gone from being just another library name to something that actually _makes sense_ to me as a developer.

One of the biggest realizations I had was understanding how React handles data: from top to bottom. That means when you want to use the same piece of state across different components, you usually have to pass it down manually — also known as "prop drilling". It works, but in larger applications, it becomes frustrating, messy, and even affects performance.

Zustand solves this beautifully. It gives you a global store that any component can access directly. And not just that — Zustand allows you to subscribe to **only the exact part** of the state that a component needs. That means fewer re-renders and a much smoother user experience. This approach not only eliminates prop drilling but also minimizes unnecessary re-renders, which improves both performance and code clarity.

Another thing I learned is the difference between re-rendering and data loss. I originally thought re-rendering was the cause of data disappearing, but it turns out, that happens because of how React stores state in memory (RAM). When the app refreshes, that memory is wiped. Zustand’s `persist` middleware fixes that by storing state in localStorage, so things like user data or cart contents can stay intact across page reloads.

I also explored how Zustand compares to React’s built-in Context API. While Context helps avoid prop drilling, it re-renders **all components** that subscribe to it when anything changes. Zustand, on the other hand, is more precise and efficient.

This experience showed me the real-world need for tools like Zustand, especially when managing things like authentication, user state, or UI toggles. I've even realized how some of the things I previously tried to handle with vanilla JavaScript (like manually changing the DOM) are now way easier and cleaner thanks to React and Zustand.

The biggest takeaway for me is that Zustand isn't just "another tool" — it's a mindset shift. It's about managing application state in a smarter way that fits the way modern front-end apps are built. And as someone aiming to become a professional developer, that's exactly the kind of approach I want to build on.

## Conclusion

Through this case study, I’ve gained a much clearer understanding of state management and why tools like Zustand are so valuable in real projects. Zustand felt overwhelming at first, but once I understood how it fits into the way React works — top-down data flow, the problems of prop drilling, and the importance of performance — it all started to make sense.

I now see Zustand not just as a tool for “global state”, but as a cleaner, more scalable way to organize my application logic. It offers both simplicity and flexibility, letting me avoid complex setups like Redux or the performance issues of Context API.

Perhaps most importantly, this process has made me think differently about how I build apps. It’s not just about getting things to work — it’s about choosing the right tools for the job, thinking ahead about structure, and writing code that is easier to manage as projects grow.

Learning Zustand gave me confidence, and this assignment reminded me how much I actually enjoy learning when it connects to something real. I'm glad I took the time to dig deep — it gave me a solid perspective I’ll take with me into future development work.
